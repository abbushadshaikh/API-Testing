API Testing for RESTful Services: 
 
 
 1. Using Postman for Manual API Testing
 2. Create Requests: Use Postman to manually create and test API requests. Validate responses, status codes, and data integrity.

Example 1:
   GET Request: https://api.example.com/products
   Expected Response: 200 OK with a list of products.


Run the Script: Execute your script to automate API testing. 

You can expand the script to cover various API endpoints and edge cases and also can create more test cases.


Test Case 2: Multi-step Workflow: 

Scenario: Simulate a complete user workflow such as registration, login, and performing an action (e.g., placing an order).

Expected Result: Each step should complete successfully, with data flowing correctly through the API.

Test Case 3: Delete Resource

Scenario: Send a DELETE request to remove a specific resource.

Expected Result: Receive a 204 No Content status indicating successful deletion.
